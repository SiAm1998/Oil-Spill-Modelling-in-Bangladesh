# Oil-Spill-Modelling-in-Bangladesh
I have modelled the fate and trajectories of hypothetical oil spills near Chattogram and Mongla port, Bangladesh using OpenOil module of the OpenDrift framework


## Project Description

As part of my final year research, I simulated multiple oil spill scenarios using real oceanographic data and visualized the dispersal patterns using Python and OpenDrift.


##  Tools Used
- Python
- OpenDrift (OpenOil module)
- NetCDF
- VS Code 
- Cartopy, Matplotlib, etc
